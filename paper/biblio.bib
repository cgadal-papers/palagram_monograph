  abstract      = {Abstract The evolution of ripple geometries and their equilibrium states due to different wave forcing parameters are investigated by a Reynolds-averaged two-phase model, SedFoam, in a two-dimensional domain. Modeled ripple geometries, for a given uniform grain diameter, show a good agreement with ripple predictors that include the wave period effect explicitly, in addition to the wave orbital excursion length (or wave orbital velocity amplitude). Furthermore, using a series of numerical experiments, the ripple's response to a step-change in the wave forcing is studied. The model is capable of simulating ``splitting,'' ``sliding,'' ``merging,'' and ``protruding'' as the ripples evolve to a new equilibrium state. The model can also simulate the transition to sheet flow in energetic wave conditions and ripple reformation from a nearly flat bed condition. Simulation results reveal that the equilibrium state is such that the ``primary'' vortices reach half of the ripple length. Furthermore, an analysis of the suspended load and near-bed load ratio in the equilibrium state indicates that in the orbital ripple regime, the near-bed load is dominant while the suspended load is conducive to the ripple decaying regime (suborbital ripples) and sheet flow condition.},

  abstract      = {The capability of an Eulerian two-phase model, SedFoam, in simulating the onset of scour underneath a pipeline and the backfill process is investigated. When a pipeline is slightly buried in the sediment bed, the scour onset can be caused by the piping process, which is due to seepage flow moving underneath the pipeline driven by the upstream--downstream pressure difference. To directly resolve piping as part of the scour simulation has been a challenge in the single-phase models. Alternatively, the two-phase models may be capable of simulating piping and backfill as it can resolve the interactions between the flow, structure, sediment transport, and seepage flow using a single set of governing equations and closures. To prove this point, SedFoam is validated by two laboratory experiments for the onset of scour underneath a pipeline. For piping driven by a prescribed upstream--downstream pressure difference, the model captures the temporal evolution of the pore-pressure gradient and the resulting fine-scale bathymetric change around the pipe consistent with the measured data. The model further provides insight into the seepage flow and the creeping movement of sediments during the onset of scour. When simulating piping driven by a unidirectional current, SedFoam successfully predicts piping driven by the upstream--downstream pressure gradient due to the incoming flow deceleration by the presence of pipeline and flow separation. As a proof-of-concept application, SedFoam is applied to simulate pipeline scour driven by an oscillatory flow. Although the boundary layer streaming effect is neglected, the model result shows realistic scour onset and the development of a scour hole. To demonstrate the model's capability to simulate the backfill process, the pipeline is then lowered artificially into the scour hole as an idealized treatment of the complex pipeline sinking process during scour. The resulting burial depth due to backfill is similar to that predicted by the empirical formula.},
